abstract: "Flavor-specific scalar bosons exist in various Standard Model
  extensions and couple to a single generation of fermions via a global flavor
  symmetry breaking mechanism. Given this strategy, we propose a MeV
  flavor-specific scalar model in dimension-5 operator series, which explains
  the muon g-2 anomaly and proton radius puzzle by coupling with the muon and
  down-quark at the same time. The framework is consistent with the null result
  of high-intensity searches. Specifically, the supernova constraints for muon
  couplings become weakened by including the contribution of down-quark
  interaction. The parameter space for explaining muon g-2 discrepancy is
  available when 10% energy deposition is required in the energy explosion
  process in the supernova, but this is ruled out by the 1% energy deposition
  requirement. We also investigate the searches for mediator and dark matter and
  the resulting constraints on viable parameter space such as nuclear physics
  constraints, direct detection for light boosted dark matter, and possible CMB
  constraints. When compared with conventional dark matter production, light
  dark matter production has two additional modifications: bound state formation
  and early kinetic equilibrium decoupling. We are now looking into the
  implications of these effects on the relic density of light dark matter."
