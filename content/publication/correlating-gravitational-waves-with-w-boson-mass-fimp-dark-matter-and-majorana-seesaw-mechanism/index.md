abstract: We study a minimal extension of the Standard Model by introducing
  three right-handed neutrinos and a new scotogenic scalar doublet, in which the
  mass splittings between neutral and charged components are responsible for the
  W-boson mass newly measured by the CDF collaboration. This model can not only
  generate non-vanishing Majorana neutrino masses via the interaction of
  right-handed neutrinos and scotogenic scalars, but also explain the Universeâ€™s
  missing matter in the form of FIMP dark matter. We also study the influence of
  the mass splitting on the first order electroweak phase transition, and find
  that it can further enhance the transition strength and thus induce
  gravitational waves during the phase transition, which may be detected in the
  forthcoming detectors such as U-DECIGO.
