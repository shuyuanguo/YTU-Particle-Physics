abstract: " In this work, we study the long-standing experimental anomaly in
  muon (g−2) and also the recent anomalous excess in K_L \\to \\pi_0 +
  \\nu\\bar\\nu at the J-PARC KOTO experiment with sgoldstino. After
  supersymmetry breaking, the interactions between quarks and sgoldstino (s)
  make the decays K → π^ +  s sizable through loop diagrams, which affects the
  measurements of decays K → π ^+ invisible. Furthermore, the couplings between
  photons and sgoldstino contribute to ∆aμ as well as the bino-slepton
  contribution. With satisfying all known experimental constraints such as from
  NA62, E949, E137, Orsay, KTEV, and CHARM experiments, these two anomalies can
  be explained simultaneously. The mass of CP-even sgoldstino is close to the
  neutral pion mass which does not violate the Grossman- Nir bound. The
  parameter space can be further tested in future NA62, DUNE experiments, as
  well as experiments in the LHC."
