title: Freeze-in dark matter through neutrino portal with an early matter era
  and EvoEMD
abstract: Dark Matter is an important direction for pursuing physics beyond the
  Standard Model. There are already various experiments searching for the Dark
  Matter. However, for the Freeze-In Dark Matter, due to the extremely tiny
  coupling between the dark matter and SM particles, there will be no
  sensitivity for the DM experiments. On the other hand, we actually have no
  direct evidence for the evolution of the Universe before BBN/CMB. This
  provides the possibility that we can add an early matter dominant era, which
  will also change the accumulation of the Freeze-In dark matter. We investigate
  such case in a neutrino portal dark matter model, and find that in order to
  overcome the faster expansion during the EMD as well as the dilution induced
  from the entropy production, larger coupling between DM and the SM particles
  is needed which also leads to detectable signal in DM experiments. In the
  second part of this talk, I will present the package EvoEMD that can be used
  to consider cosmic evolution with or without an early matter-dominated era.
