title: A self-consistent light-front quark model and its application in B decays
abstract: >-
  The heavy hadron EW decay plays an important role in testing the Standard
  Model, searching for the indirect hint of new physics and investigating the
  feature of hadron. The decay constant, form factor and distribution amplitude
  are crucial non-perturbative inputs for evaluating heavy hadron EW decay. The
  standard light-front (SLF) and the covariant light-front (CLF) quark models
  provide conceptually simple and phenomenologically feasible frameworks for
  calculating these quantities. In this talk, the self-consistence and strict
  covariance problems of CLF approach are discussed, and a possible solution is
  tested. Then, based on a self-consistent CLF framework, some rare decays (for
  instance, semileptonic and non-leptonic decay of heavy vector mesons, B → Tlν
  and B → K0*(1430)M decay, et al.) are

  investigated.
